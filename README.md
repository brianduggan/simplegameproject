This Blackjack game is a project for General Assembly's WDI course. The game utilizes jQuery and event listeners to manipulate the DOM and play a round of Blackjack.

Future versions of the game will clear the playing board and allow for additional hands to be played. The game is currently able to be played on a mobile device but will need tweaking to improve user experience.
